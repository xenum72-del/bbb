Example: "All 147 encounters have valid friend references"
Confidence Level: High - this aspect of data is healthy
```

#### **⚠️ Warning (Yellow)**
```
Meaning: Test found minor issues or potential concerns
Action Required: Review and consider fixing
Example: "2 friends missing age information"
Confidence Level: Medium - minor data quality issues
```

#### **❌ Fail (Red)**
```

```

#### **Health Score Interpretation**
```
95-100%: Excellent - Data is in optimal condition
90-94%:  Very Good - Minor issues, mostly healthy
80-89%:  Good - Some issues need attention
70-79%:  Fair - Multiple issues, cleanup recommended
60-69%:  Poor - Significant problems, action required
<60%:    Critical - Major data integrity issues
```

## 🚨 Emergency Data Recovery

### When Tests Reveal Serious Issues

#### **Data Corruption Detection**
```
Signs of Corruption:
- Multiple failed integrity tests
- Impossible data values (negative durations, etc.)
- Missing critical data (all encounters gone, etc.)
- Inconsistent friend-encounter relationships
- App crashes during data access
```

#### **Recovery Procedures**
```
Step 1: Stop Using App
- Don't add new data until issue resolved
- Prevent further corruption

Step 2: Assess Damage
- Run complete test suite
- Document all failed tests
- Identify scope of corruption

Step 3: Recovery Options
- Restore from most recent clean backup
- Partial restoration of corrupted sections
- Manual data reconstruction if necessary
- Fresh start with available backup data

Step 4: Prevention
- Implement more frequent backup schedule
- Regular testing to catch issues early
- Investigate root cause of corruption
```

### Data Loss Prevention

#### **Backup Verification Testing**
```
Regular Backup Validation:
- Test restore process monthly
- Verify backup file integrity
- Confirm all data types included
- Check backup file accessibility
- Validate encryption/decryption process
```

#### **Redundant Protection Strategy**
```
Multiple Protection Layers:
1. Automatic Azure backups (weekly)
2. Manual JSON exports (monthly)
3. Cloud storage backup copies (quarterly)
4. Device-to-device backup transfer (as needed)
5. Emergency contact backup sharing (critical data only)
```
