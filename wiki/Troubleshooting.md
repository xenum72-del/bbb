## üì± Installation & Setup Issues

### "Add to Home Screen" Not Available

#### **Problem**: Can't find "Add to Home Screen" option in Safari

4. **Try private browsing**: Open in private tab first, then try regular Safari

#### **Step-by-Step Fix**:
```
1. Open Safari (not Chrome/Firefox)
2. Go to the app URL
3. Wait 10-15 seconds for complete loading
4. Tap Share button (‚ñ°‚Üë)

3. **Try partial terms**: Search for parts of names/locations
4. **Case sensitivity**: Search is case-insensitive, so that shouldn't matter
5. **Data refresh**: Pull down to refresh data

### Maps/Location Features Not Working

#### **Problem**: Maps don't load, location features unavailable
#### **Solutions**:
1. **Enable location services**: Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Location Services ‚Üí Safari
