## 🛠️ Managing Interaction Types

The Load Down includes a powerful **Interaction Type Manager** for customizing your activity categories. Access it through Settings → Manage Types.

#### **✨ Manager Features**
```
🔍 Search & Filter: Find activities instantly with live search
📊 Usage Statistics: See count of encounters for each activity type
🎨 Color & Icon Display: Visual identification of each type
🗑️ Safe Deletion: Delete unused types with data migration protection
🔄 Data Migration: Map deleted types to existing ones to preserve data
🧹 Clean Interface: Compact, organized view of all activities
```

#### **Accessing Type Manager**
```
Path: Settings → Data Management → Manage Types
Shortcut: Settings page → "Manage Types" button
Developer Mode: Additional debugging features available
```

### 🔍 Search Functionality

#### **Smart Search Features**
- **Live Filtering**: Results update as you type
- **Case Insensitive**: Search works regardless of capitalization
- **Partial Matching**: Find activities with partial name matches
- **Clear Button**: Quickly reset search to see all activities

#### **Search Examples**
```
Search "oral" → Shows: Oral (Giving), Oral (Receiving)
Search "date" → Shows: Coffee Date, Dinner Date
Search "anal" → Shows: Anal (Topping), Anal (Bottoming)
Search "massage" → Shows: Body Contact/Massage
```

### 📊 Usage Statistics

#### **Encounter Counts**
Each activity type displays its usage count showing:
- **Total Encounters**: Number of encounters using this activity
- **Main Activity**: Count when used as primary encounter type
- **Secondary Activity**: Count when included in activities performed
- **Real-Time Updates**: Counts update automatically when data changes

#### **Understanding Usage Data**
```
Usage Count Calculation:
• Counts unique encounters (not duplicates)
• Includes both main activity and secondary activity usage
• Updates immediately when encounters are added/modified
• Helps identify your most and least used activity types
```

### �️ Safe Type Deletion

#### **Data Protection Features**
The type manager includes comprehensive data protection when deleting activities:

```
Safety Measures:
🛡️ Usage Check: Shows count of encounters using the type
🔄 Data Migration: Map encounters to replacement activity
📋 Confirmation Dialog: Multiple confirmation steps
�🔒 Integrity Validation: Ensures no data is orphaned
```

#### **Deletion Process**
```
1. Select activity type to delete
2. View usage count (encounters that use this type)
3. Choose replacement activity from dropdown
4. Confirm mapping of existing encounters
5. Confirm final deletion
6. System automatically updates all encounters
```

#### **Data Migration Example**
```
Scenario: Deleting "Old Activity Name" (used in 5 encounters)
Action: Map to "New Activity Name"
Result: All 5 encounters now use "New Activity Name"
Outcome: No data lost, consistent categorization maintained
```

### 🚫 Equality of All Types

#### **No Special "Default" Types**
Unlike previous versions, **all interaction types are now equal**:
- **No Protected Types**: Any activity can be deleted if not in use
- **User Control**: Complete flexibility in customizing your activity list
- **Clean Data**: Remove activities you don't use for better organization
- **Custom Workflows**: Adapt the app to your specific needs

#### **Historical Note**
Previous versions had artificial "default type" restrictions. This has been removed based on user feedback to provide complete customization freedom.

### 🔧 Advanced Management

#### **Developer Mode Features**
When developer mode is enabled (tap Settings title 7 times), additional features become available:

```
Developer Tools:
• validateSampleDataIntegrity(): Fix orphaned type references
• Data integrity checking and validation
• Advanced debugging information
• Console access to type management functions
```

#### **Data Integrity Protection**
```
Automatic Safeguards:
✅ Orphaned reference detection
✅ Automatic data migration during type changes
✅ Sample data updates when types are modified
✅ Backup compatibility preservation
✅ Analytics calculation consistency
```

### 📈 Analytics Integration

#### **Type Usage in Analytics**
The Analytics page shows comprehensive activity statistics that integrate with type management:
- **Activity Breakdown**: Shows usage of each activity type
- **Main vs Secondary**: Distinguishes primary and additional activities
- **Consistent Counting**: Uses same calculation methods as type manager
- **Real-Time Updates**: Analytics update when types are modified

#### **Calculation Consistency**
```
Unified Calculation Method:
• Analytics and Type Manager use identical counting logic
• Prevents discrepancies between different app sections
• Ensures accurate usage statistics across all features
• Updates automatically when data changes
```

## 🎯 Best Practices for Type Management

### 🧹 Regular Maintenance

#### **Quarterly Review**
```
Review Process:
1. Open Interaction Type Manager
2. Sort by usage count (lowest first)
3. Identify unused or rarely used types
4. Consider deleting or mapping to more common types
5. Keep frequently used types for consistency
```

#### **Benefits of Cleanup**
- **Faster Selection**: Fewer options when logging encounters
- **Better Analytics**: More meaningful activity breakdowns
- **Consistent Data**: Using similar types for related activities
- **Personal Relevance**: Activity list matches your actual experiences

### 🔄 Migration Strategies

#### **Consolidating Similar Types**
```
Example Consolidation:
Delete: "Coffee Date", "Coffee Meeting", "Café Chat"
Map to: "Coffee Date"
Result: All coffee-related encounters use consistent categorization
```

#### **Seasonal Cleanup**
```
End of Year Review:
• Identify types used less than 3 times
• Map experimental types to established ones
• Remove temporary or one-off categories
• Prepare clean type list for new year
```

### 📊 Usage-Based Decisions

#### **Keep High-Usage Types**
```
Retention Criteria:
✅ Used in 10+ encounters
✅ Regular ongoing usage
✅ Clear, specific meaning
✅ Distinct from other types
```

#### **Consider Removing Low-Usage Types**
```
Removal Candidates:
❓ Used in 1-2 encounters only
❓ Similar to other existing types
❓ Experimental or unclear meaning
❓ Temporary or situation-specific
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting Type Management

### Common Issues

#### **Usage Count Discrepancies**
```
Problem: Type manager shows different count than Analytics
Solution: 
• Both now use identical calculation methods
• Counts should always match
• If discrepancy persists, use developer tools to validate data integrity
```

#### **Data Migration Problems**
```
Problem: Encounters lost after type deletion
Solution:
• Type deletion includes automatic data migration
• All encounters mapped to replacement type
• Use validateSampleDataIntegrity() in developer mode if issues persist
```

#### **Search Not Working**
```
Problem: Search doesn't find expected types
Solution:
• Check spelling and try partial matches
• Search is case-insensitive
• Clear search and browse alphabetically
• Ensure type actually exists in current list
```
