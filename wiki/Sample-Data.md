- **Confirmation Required**: App requires explicit confirmation before proceeding

#### Backup Recommendations
```
Before generating sample data:
1. Create Azure backup (if configured)
2. Export JSON backup to Files app
3. Confirm backups are accessible
4. Only then proceed with sample generation
```

### Privacy & Security

- **Biometric Auth**: All security features remain active
- **Session Management**: Auto-lock and security settings preserved
- **Encryption**: If enabled, sample data is encrypted like real data

### Performance Considerations

#### Generation Impact
- **Processing Time**: 5-10 seconds for complete generation
- **Memory Usage**: Temporary spike during generation process
- **Storage Space**: ~5-10MB additional storage required
- **Battery Impact**: Minimal - single operation

#### Ongoing Performance
- **App Speed**: Large dataset may slightly slow some operations
- **Search Performance**: More data means search takes slightly longer
- **Analytics Calculation**: Complex statistics may take extra time
- **Backup Size**: Larger backups due to more data
