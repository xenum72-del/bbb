# 📊 Anonymous Analytics - Privacy-First Data Collection

> **Understanding The Load Down's completely anonymous usage analytics and your privacy controls**

---

## 🎯 What Are Anonymous Analytics?

**Anonymous Analytics** in The Load Down are completely privacy-preserving usage statistics that help improve the app without compromising your personal information. These analytics are **disabled by default** and require your explicit consent to enable.

**Core Principles:**
- **🔒 Anonymous by Design**: No personal data, ever
- **🛡️ Privacy First**: Your encounters and friends stay private
- **📊 Usage Only**: App interactions, not personal content
- **🎛️ Your Control**: Enable/disable anytime with zero impact
- **🌐 Aggregated Insights**: Population-level patterns, not individual tracking

## 🔍 What Data Is Collected (If Enabled)

### ✅ Anonymous Usage Data

#### **App Interaction Patterns**
```
Navigation Analytics:
- Page views (Dashboard, Timeline, Friends, Analytics, Settings)
- Button clicks and user interface interactions
- Feature usage frequency (encounter logging, friend management)
- Session duration and app engagement time
- Feature adoption rates (which features are used most)

Technical Performance:
- App load times and performance metrics
- Error rates and crash reporting (no personal context)
- Device performance impact
- Network usage patterns
- Storage usage efficiency
```

#### **Geographic Aggregation (City/State Level)**
```
Location Analytics (Very General):
- City or state level only (e.g., "San Francisco, CA")
- No precise coordinates or addresses
- Used for: Understanding user distribution
- Not linked to: Specific encounters or personal locations
- Aggregated with: Hundreds of other users

Example Data Point:
"Users in San Francisco use the Analytics page 25% more than average"
(Not: "User X visited location Y at time Z")
```

#### **App Version & Platform Data**
```
Technical Environment:
- App version number (for compatibility tracking)
- iOS version (for optimization and compatibility)
